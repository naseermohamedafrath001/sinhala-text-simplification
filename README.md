# Sinhala Text Simplification Research Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sinhala Text Simplification** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The main goal of the research is to automatically simplify complex Sinhala text into a more readable and understandable form while preserving the original meaning.

We trained, modified, and evaluated our model using an existing publicly available dataset and further fine-tuned it to suit our research objectives.
